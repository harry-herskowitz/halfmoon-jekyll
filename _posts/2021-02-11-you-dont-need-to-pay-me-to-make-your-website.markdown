Hi. I know this is weird. Why would I tell you to make your own website instead of just taking your business? Two reasons: 1) You are a young entrepreneur who should learn this stuff in order to have real control of your business. 2) You probably can't afford me. Either way, I want to help. So, here's a quick guide on setting up your own site.

First, I'll give you the easiest options. If you just want a blog with a custom domain, you can get a WordPress site on wordpress.com for as little as $4 a month. I'd suggest this to anyone who isn't technologically inclined. If you can afford $30 a month, there's also Squarespace, Wix, and my favorite: Ghost.

If you can't afford more than $4 a month, but need full WordPress features, then you'll have to host it yourself. It'll cost about $45 a year ($3.75 a month). Here's how to do that:

1. Pick a hosting provider. My go-to is Reclaim Hosting, but here is a list of the most popular ones. Just follow the sign up process and pick a domain and hosting plan.

2. Install WordPress. This process will be different depending on what host you use. On Reclaim, you go to cPanel and look for the WordPress button under Applications. It'll ask you what domain format you want to use - choose https://yourdomain.com. Make sure you leave the directory section blank. Name your site, give it a tagline, and set your username and password (don't forget it!). You can keep all the default settings.

3. You now have a WordPress site. Sign into the admin panel by adding /wp-admin to the end of your domain (ex. yourdomain.com/wp-admin) and sign in.

4. Learn how to use WordPress! Here is the official guide. Knowing how to use WordPress is an invaluable skill that will empower you in your entrepreneurial endeavors, as well as make you more of an asset to future employers.

I hope this was helpful. If after reading this you still want to hire me anyway, that's fine with me! At least you are now more educated on what's going on behind the scenes.
